* note that instruction classifiction is based on not only opcode but also with funct7 and fucnt3.

## I-type Instruction
### ADDI
```
ADDI rd, rs1, imm -> rd = rs1 + imm
```
### ANDI
```
ANDI rd, rs1, imm -> rd = rs1 & imm
```
### ORI
```
ORI rd, rs1, imm -> rd = rs1 | imm
```
### XORI
```
XORI rd, rs1, imm -> rd = rs1 ^ imm
```

### SLLI
```
SLL rd, rs1, rs2 -> rd = rs1 << rs2
```
* note that in order to perform logical operation, the operand value should be cast to (uint 32).

### SRAI
```
SRA rd, rs1, rs2 -> rd = rs1 >> rs2
```
* perform arithmatic shift, which means sign extension is operated during the operatin.

### SRLI
```
SRL rd, rs1, rs2 -> rd = rs1 >> rs2
```
* note that in order to perform logical operation, the operand value should be cast to (uint 32).

### SLTI
```
SLTI rd, rs1, rs2 -> rd = rs1 < imm
```

### SLTIU
```
SLTIU rd, rs1, rs2 -> rd = (uint32_t)rs1 < (uint32_t)imm
```

## R-type Instruction
### ADD
```
ADD rd, rs1, rs2 -> rd = rs1 + rs2
```
### SUB
```
SUB rd, rs1, rs2 -> rd = rs1 - rs2
```
### AND
```
AND rd, rs1, rs2 -> rd = rs1 & rs2
```
* note that the AND and similar operation in RISC-V is bitwise operation, not logical.
### OR
```
OR rd, rs1, rs2 -> rd = rs1 | rs2
```
### XOR
```
XOR rd, rs1, rs2 -> rd = rs1 ^ rs2
```

### SLL
```
SLL rd, rs1, rs2 -> rd = rs1 << rs2
```
* note that in order to perform logical operation, the operand value should be cast to (uint 32).

### SRA
```
SRA rd, rs1, rs2 -> rd = rs1 >> rs2
```

### SRL
```
SRL rd, rs1, rs2 -> rd = rs1 >> rs2
```
* note that in order to perform logical operation, the operand value should be cast to (uint 32).

### SLT
```
SLT rd, rs1, rs2 -> rd = rs1 < rs2
```

### SLTU
```
SLTU rd, rs1, rs2 -> rd = (uint32_t)rs1 < (uint32_t)rs2
```

## U-type Instruction
### LUI
```
LUI rd, imm -> rd = (int32_t)imm << 12
```
* note that imm is sign extended before shift left by 12 bits.

### AUIPC
```
AUIPC rd, imm -> rd = pc + ((int32_t)imm << 12)
```
* note that imm is sign extended before shift left by 12 bits.

## B-type Instruction
### BEQ
```
BEQ rs1, rs2, offset -> if (rs1 == rs2) pc += offset
```

### BNE
```
BNE rs1, rs2, offset -> if (rs1 != rs2) pc += offset
```

### BLT
```
BLT rs1, rs2, offset -> if (rs1 < rs2) pc += offset
```

### BGE
```
BGE rs1, rs2, offset -> if (rs1 >= rs2) pc += offset
```
* not that bge include equality (bge stands for branch if greater or equal to).

### BLTU
```
BLTU rs1, rs2, offset -> if ((uint32_t)rs1 < (uint32_t)rs2) pc += offset
```

### BGEU
```
BGEU rs1, rs2, offset -> if ((uint32_t)rs1 >= (uint32_t)rs2) pc += offset
```
